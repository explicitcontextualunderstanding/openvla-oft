# Executive Summary

A fully optimized Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system for autonomous robotics, tuned to run in real time (≥3 Hz) on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super under JetPack 6.2.1. This project addresses deploying capable VLA models within an 8 GB VRAM and 25 W power envelope by applying quantization, structured sparsity, TensorRT optimization, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Targeted at robotics engineering and edge AI platform teams, it delivers reusable containers, inference engines, and automation pipelines—reducing time-to-field by 50 % and inference hardware TCO by 30 %.

## Problem Statement

Modern VLA models (e.g., OpenVLA 7 B, SmolVLA 450 M) demand 15–30 GB GPU memory in standard precisions, making them unsuitable for 8 GB VRAM edge devices. Pain points:

- Out-of-Memory (OOM) Failures
- Latency Spikes
- Unsupported Operators in TensorRT
- Accuracy Loss after compression
- Integration Complexity with ROS 2 pipelines

Existing approaches either offload inference to the cloud—incurring latency—or dramatically simplify models. A robust on-device VLA is urgently needed.

## Proposed Solution

An end-to-end tuning pipeline and deployment framework that adapts reference VLA models via:  

1. **Baseline Profiling & Budgeting**  
   - Datasets: VQA v2, COCO captions, navigation instruction dataset  
   - Benchmark scripts and owners: profiling.py (ML Engineer), power_profiler.py (Embedded Engineer)  
   - VRAM/Power budget (baseline): Weights 4.5 GB, Activations 1.0 GB, KV Cache 0.5 GB, Workspace 0.5 GB, Container overhead 0.5 GB; Power headroom 5 W  
   - Stretch reassessment once INT4 support lands: target ≤5 GB total VRAM with ≤300 ms p95 latency  

2. **INT8/FP16 Quantization Path (Baseline)** using TensorRT QAT/PTQ where supported  
3. **4-bit Quantization Experiments** (stretch goal) gated on upstream TensorRT-LLM support  
4. **2:4 Structured Sparsity** targeting supported transformer blocks  
5. **TensorRT Mixed-Precision Engines** (FP16/INT8) with layer fusion  
6. **LoRA Fine-Tuning** for task recovery  
7. **Super Mode Activation** & DVFS tuning  
8. **KV-Cache Management** (chunked context)  
9. **Containerized Deployment** (JetPack 6.2.1 base)  
10. **CUTLASS-Accelerated GEMM Kernels** for custom INT4/FP16 hotspots  
11. **Comprehensive Profiling & Stress Testing**

CUTLASS integration covers the quantization-to-execution path: bit-pack INT4 weights, autotune SM87 F16×INT4 kernels via `nvidia-matmul-heuristics`, validate with CuTe prototypes, and ship the selected kernels inside the JetPack container alongside TensorRT engines.

## Target Users

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- Jetson Orin Nano Super (JetPack 6.2.1)  
- Cloud GPUs: A10G/A100/H100  
- Ubuntu 22.04 L4T  
- Power ≤25 W in Super Mode

### Technology Preferences

- PyTorch 2.x, Torch-TensorRT 1.5, NVIDIA TAO 5.x  
- TensorRT 10.3, Triton 3.x  
- GitHub Actions, Docker 20.10+, NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.14  
- Nsight Systems
- context7.monitoring for agents  
- INT4 transformer kernels remain experimental on JetPack 6.2.1/TensorRT 10.3; plan schedules around INT8/FP16 paths until NVIDIA publishes production support.
- CUTLASS v4.2.1+ with `-DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS="87"` and CuTe DSL for kernel prototyping  

### Architecture Considerations

- Monorepo: training/, conversion/, deployment/ modules

- CI gates: enforce SBOM policy checks, signed images, and ≥7-day log retention with upload hooks
- CUTLASS kernel module (`kernels/cutlass/`) with bit-packing utilities and autotuning reports checked into CI artifacts

## Operator Compatibility & Runtime API

### Operator Compatibility Checklist (Owner: ML Engineer – Mixed Precision)

- Audit model ops unsupported by TensorRT 10.3 and list fallbacks.
- Define fallback routes: FP16, CPU, or custom TensorRT plugin for each unsupported op.
- Maintain operator compatibility matrix and test vectors.

### ROS 2 Inference API Contract (Owner: Embedded Engineer)

- Topic: `/vla/inference` — message: `InferenceRequest { sensor_data, text_cmd }` → `InferenceResponse { action_seq, confidence }`.
- QoS: Reliability=Reliable, History=KeepLast(1).
- Rate limit: ≤5 Hz request rate; client backpressure behavior defined in API.
- Test harness: `ros2 launch vla_test_pipeline launch.py` for CI smoke tests.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

#### Cost-Effective Cloud Services for VLA R&D on Jetson Orin Nano Super

For systematic model tuning—quantization, pruning, LoRA, TensorRT conversion—and end-to-end validation under Jetson constraints, the following cloud offerings provide GPU and even Jetson hardware access at research-grade pricing without committing to costly production tiers.

NVIDIA Jetson DevCloud
• What: Free, on-demand remote access to Jetson AGX Orin, Xavier, and Nano hardware.
• Why: Run native JetPack 6.x workflows, build and profile TensorRT engines, and test full container stacks directly on Jetson class devices.
• Limits: Session quotas and priority queuing; ideal for intermittent R&D rather than 24×7 production testing.

- Budget: NVIDIA Jetson DevCloud and spot cloud GPUs.
- Timeline: 16 weeks to MVP; +8 weeks Phase 2.  
- Team: 5 roles.  
- Hardware: 8 GB VRAM; JetPack dependency.

### Assumptions

- Budget: Jetson DevCloud + spot cloud GPUs  
- Timeline: 16 weeks to MVP; +8 weeks Phase 2  
- Team: 5 roles (ML, Embedded, DevOps, QA)  
- Hardware: 8 GB VRAM limit; JetPack 6.2.1 dependency

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- Accuracy regression from compression  
- Plugin gaps causing CPU fallback latency  
- Thermal throttling in prolonged use  
- Integration jitter with ROS 2

### Open Questions

- Which VLA variant (7 B vs 1.5 B vs 450 M) is MVP start?  
- Super Mode firmware availability timeline  
- Accuracy metrics: VQA score, instruction success rate, BLEU
- Priority target GEMM shapes for CUTLASS INT4 kernels and benchmark dataset?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Per-layer sensitivity to quantization/pruning  
- Custom TensorRT plugin patterns for VLA ops  
- Field telemetry schema correlating environment and performance
- CUTLASS vs TensorRT kernel performance profiling across representative GEMM shapes

## 5. Risk Mitigation and Contingencies

- **Risk:** Quantization degrades critical task accuracy.  
  **Mitigation:** Implement mixed-precision fallback for sensitive layers.  

- **Risk:** Model OOMs on Jetson.  
  **Mitigation:** Iteratively reduce KV cache size; prune additional layers.  

- **Risk:** Unsupported operations in TensorRT.  
  **Mitigation:** Replace custom kernels or fallback to optimized CPU operators for isolated ops.  

- **Risk:** Performance variability under load.  
  **Mitigation:** Introduce asynchronous pipelines and priority-based resource scheduling.  

- **Risk:** CUTLASS kernel maintenance increases build complexity.  
  **Mitigation:** Keep kernels header-only with nvcc arch=87 presets, reuse CUTLASS CI examples, and validate via automated autotuning harness in CI.
